What is Pav Bhaji?
Pav Bhaji is popular Indian street food originating from Mumbai.

It has spicy mashed vegetables served with dinner rolls. Pav refers to the bread and bhaji means vegetables.

A special blend of spices known as pav bhaji masala is used to flavor the dish, which is finished with lots of butter and cilantro!

It came into existence in 1800s when cotton mill workers in the city had to work for long hours and would often miss their meals and remain hungry. So pav bhaji was that easy quick meal which was invented to feed these workers during those times.

There are different types of pav bhaji depending on how it’s made. There’s Jain version which is minus the onion and garlic. Then there’s Kathiyawadi Pav Bhaji which uses some local spices and is popular in the Kathiawar region in Gujarat. There’s also Khada Pav bhaji where vegetables are not mashed (khada=straight).
